## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing cloud-based inference for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and agentic workloads. We will explore how modern AI inference workloads can be efficiently served using cloud-native infrastructure, evaluating different components including model serving frameworks, orchestration layers, caching strategies, and GPU/accelerator utilization. The key objective is to identify performance and cost trade-offs when deploying these systems on major cloud platforms.

## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project:

**Vision**: To deliver a comprehensive benchmarking framework that enables organizations to make informed decisions about deploying scalable, high-performance AI inference systems in cloud environments, with particular focus on RAG and agentic workloads.

**High-Level Goals**:
- End-to-End Inference Flow: Build and deploy a complete inference pipeline that supports both simple chatbot interactions and more advanced agentic use cases (e.g., automating domain-specific tasks).
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implement RAG pipelines that enhance inference by incorporating external, domain-specific data at query time, improving relevance and adaptability of outputs.
- Inference Stack Optimization: Evaluate model serving frameworks such as vLLM and orchestration tools like llm-d, focusing on latency, throughput, and cost trade-offs.
- Deployment on Cloud Infrastructure: Containerize and manage the inference stack within a Kubernetes cluster, enabling reproducible, scalable deployments.
- Benchmarking and Best Practices: Develop a standardized benchmarking suite to compare configurations, analyze results, and compile findings into a final report.

**Stretch Goals**: 
- Heterogeneous Scheduling: Explore strategies for efficiently distributing workloads across CPUs and accelerators, identifying where GPU offloading provides the most performance benefit.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

**Primary Users**:
- ML Engineers who need to deploy and optimize LLM inference systems in production environments
- Cloud Architects responsible for designing scalable cloud infrastructure for AI workloads
- DevOps Engineers who manage and maintain AI inference systems in cloud environments

**Secondary Users**:
- Research Teams conducting experiments on LLM performance and efficiency
- Product Managers making decisions about AI infrastructure investments

## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:

**In Scope**:
- Core inference engine using vLLM with orchestration via llm-d
- RAG system implementation with document processing, embedding generation, and vector search
- Caching layer using Redis for embeddings, queries, and responses
- Standardized benchmarking suite with performance measurement tools (Locust/JMeter, Prometheus)
- Multi-cloud support for AWS, Azure, and Intel Gaudi accelerator testing
- Performance metrics including throughput, latency, resource utilization, and cost efficiency analysis

**Out of Scope**:
- Custom model training or fine-tuning
- Real-time production deployment beyond testing environments
- Integration with proprietary cloud services not available for testing
- Long-term production monitoring and maintenance

## 4. Solution Concept

### Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:
This project mainly includes two parts: serving and benchmarking.

For serving, this project adopts Kubernetes to manage and organize computing and storage resources, where vLLM, as the core of high-performance LLM inference that empowers various upper-level applications, such as text generation and workflows, can be deployed on different nodes along with facilities for agentic workflow, like Cloud-native vector database. Additionally, common mechanisms like load balance, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling can be supported if resources allow.
As for the benchmarking, this project includes a benchmark suite that can test different metrics (e.g., Throughput, TTFT, and TPOT) under different scenarios with adjustable payloads.

The architecture follows a phased approach with four distinct phases:

**Phase 1: vLLM** - Basic vLLM setup for LLM inference

**Phase 2: RAG System (+ Vector DB)** - Integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation system with Vector Database

**Phase 3: Caching (+ Redis Cache)** - Incorporation of caching using Redis

**Phase 4: Agentic (+ Orchestration + MCP Server + Heterogeneous Scheduling)** - Addition of agentic capabilities with MCP server and intelligent GPU/CPU task routing

The system includes request processing layer (Load Balancer, API Gateway, Task Classifier, Heterogeneous Scheduler), core inference engine (vLLM Engine, Model Registry), RAG system (Document Processor, Embedding Model, Vector Database, Retrieval Engine), agentic system (MCP Server, Orchestrator, Agentic Workflows), caching layer (Embedding Cache, Query Cache, Response Cache), and infrastructure resources (GPU Nodes, CPU Nodes, Object Storage).

### Design Implications and Discussion:

To accommodate cloud computing, all components in the serving part can be distributed. With proper configurations, the system could have high availability and be robust to the single point of failure (SPOF). At the same time, it also allows the dynamic scaling just in case the computing resource runs out.

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
